# Droid_Invasion

Droid Invasion is an arcade-style game that takes inspiration from the classic "Droid Invasion" plug and play game. In this game, you control a lightsaber-wielding character who must defend against waves of enemy droids. Deflect enemy bullets using your lightsaber, defeat droids, and survive as long as possible to achieve a high score.

Gameplay:

Use the 'A' key to move the character left and the 'D' key to move right.
Your character's lightsaber automatically reflects bullets back towards enemies.
Defeat enemy droids by reflecting their bullets back at them.
Avoid allowing enemy droids to reach the bottom of the screen to stay in the game.
Earn points for each defeated enemy droid and try to beat your high score!

Features:

Intuitive keyboard controls for character movement.
Various enemy droid types with unique characteristics.
Automatic firing of enemy bullets.
Collision detection for reflected bullets and enemy droids.
High score tracking and display.
Game over screen with an option to reset the high score.
